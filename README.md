# RealTimeImageDetection
This is a project I have completed when I worked as a software intern in Upbeat Technology. I chose to use Tensorflow Object Detection API, since
it could be transformed into a light version, and then it could be put into Rasberry Pi. This program aims to detect 5 different hand gestures, and 
I collected and labeled the images by myself. For more reference and the final demonstration video, please see my power point file in the repository.

image.ipynb is for taking pictures, and Tutorial.ipynb is for setting the environment and detecting hand gestures.
